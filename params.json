If I can do it, then so can you! \r\n\r\n-----------------------\r\ndef You_Rock!\r\n\r\nif \"You scored more than 650 combined on both your English and Math portions of your SATs\"\r\n\r\nthen puts \"you're smarter than me.\"\r\n\r\nelsif \"You did not do Special Ed in grad school, because you couldn't keep up due to an inability to read books without falling asleep on them.\" \r\n#Computers changed my life, because they fed pixels to my eyes and keep me awake. \r\n\r\nputs \"You're smarter than me.\r\n\r\nelsif \"You had to have tutors for almost everything you studied just to keep up.\"\r\n\r\nputs \"You're smarter than me.\"\r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\nputs \"It doesn't matter what your background is, you are as smart as I am. You can do it. Just commit yourself and be determined and you'll be guru at whatever topic you are focused on. So with that, all you need is the commitment to self to follow through and put the effort into learning and continuing to learn as needed. With that, the universe will put the people and resources in your path as long as you make the steps forward and stay the course.\"\r\nend\r\nend\r\n\r\nYou_Rock!  \r\n#Thanks for following! \r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nI have no clue where I will be and what I will be doing in 5 years.
